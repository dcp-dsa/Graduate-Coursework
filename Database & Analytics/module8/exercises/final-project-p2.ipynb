I then landed a data science  job with the federal government. I am a newbie data scientist and really don&#x27;t feel comfortable calling myself that anyway. <br><br>**The good**<br><br>In my nearly two months on the job, I have learned: <br><br>1) how pipelines work, specifically the targets package in R. To make for reproducibility and shorter run times on projects that branch (basically using a split-apply-combine approach that doesn&#x27;t rerun the same code when nothing has changed).<br><br>2) a little bit on the tidyverse. People love that here and I&#x27;m used to writing in base R. At least now I know what people are doing although it&#x27;s going to be hard switching to writing piped operations myself.<br><br>3) how to use containers, specifically docker. Useful for when you want code to not break down the road when packages and software get updated. Wish I had used this earlier. I guess if you code in python and manage your environments with anaconda you don&#x27;t need this (?) <br><br>4) how to run code and I/O data from a remote machine (high performance computer). And how to spin up a container with a .slurm script on the remote that opens up Rstudio. This way you can work as you normally would on your local. Really grateful for this.<br><br>5) a little bit more on git for version control. The part that I had missing was working collaboratively on branches, making pull requests, and managing conflicts-things I didn&#x27;t  really need to learn since all my previous projects had been solo ventures (gradschool and post grad work). <br><br>In the months to come, I will also have to learn how to correctly deliver data and project outputs on gitlab, Amazon s3 buckets, science base, etc. I will probably take a python course to be able to read other people&#x27;s code at the very least. Also, object oriented programming is on the wish list of things to learn. <br><br>**The bad**<br><br>Lots of acronyms floating around in discussions that make me lose the thread. The discussions seem really fast-paced and I can&#x27;t keep up. Some of it is probably because these discussions are not relevant to me, but I still have to listen and follow in case they are. Sometimes words are used interchangeably to refer to the same thing, which makes it hard to keep up too. <br><br>Reading other people&#x27;s code is difficult. But I have to say, my coworkers are rock stars and have very well-documented clean code. They are also generous with explaining what is happening and why with the code that they have written. <br><br>**The ugly**<br><br>I&#x27;m not sure if I can be of any help to projects since there are so many capable people around. Battling feelings of inadequacy and trying my best to catch up. <br><br>Almost half my time has been bogged down  in administrative type stuff. Very little project work has happened so far. I find this very tedious. <br><br>Lots of time spent on video and audio which is tiring. I feel very &quot;watched&quot; on video as it&#x27;s hard to know who is looking where. Also difficult to time when to jump into or change a conversation. I miss the separation of work and life. <br><br>That&#x27;s all folks. Thanks for reading.<br><br>**tl;dr** learned about pipe lining, tidy verse, containers, hpc, and more git stuff. Hated the communication breakdowns, administrative time-sinks, and the many virtual meetings.</td>\n",

I then landed a data science  job with the federal government. I am a newbie data scientist and really don&#x27;t feel comfortable calling myself that anyway. <br><br>**The good**<br><br>In my nearly two months on the job, I have learned: <br><br>1) how pipelines work, specifically the targets package in R. To make for reproducibility and shorter run times on projects that branch (basically using a split-apply-combine approach that doesn&#x27;t rerun the same code when nothing has changed).<br><br>2) a little bit on the tidyverse. People love that here and I&#x27;m used to writing in base R. At least now I know what people are doing although it&#x27;s going to be hard switching to writing piped operations myself.<br><br>3) how to use containers, specifically docker. Useful for when you want code to not break down the road when packages and software get updated. Wish I had used this earlier. I guess if you code in python and manage your environments with anaconda you don&#x27;t need this (?) <br><br>4) how to run code and I/O data from a remote machine (high performance computer). And how to spin up a container with a .slurm script on the remote that opens up Rstudio. This way you can work as you normally would on your local. Really grateful for this.<br><br>5) a little bit more on git for version control. The part that I had missing was working collaboratively on branches, making pull requests, and managing conflicts-things I didn&#x27;t  really need to learn since all my previous projects had been solo ventures (gradschool and post grad work). <br><br>In the months to come, I will also have to learn how to correctly deliver data and project outputs on gitlab, Amazon s3 buckets, science base, etc. I will probably take a python course to be able to read other people&#x27;s code at the very least. Also, object oriented programming is on the wish list of things to learn. <br><br>**The bad**<br><br>Lots of acronyms floating around in discussions that make me lose the thread. The discussions seem really fast-paced and I can&#x27;t keep up. Some of it is probably because these discussions are not relevant to me, but I still have to listen and follow in case they are. Sometimes words are used interchangeably to refer to the same thing, which makes it hard to keep up too. <br><br>Reading other people&#x27;s code is difficult. But I have to say, my coworkers are rock stars and have very well-documented clean code. They are also generous with explaining what is happening and why with the code that they have written. <br><br>**The ugly**<br><br>I&#x27;m not sure if I can be of any help to projects since there are so many capable people around. Battling feelings of inadequacy and trying my best to catch up. <br><br>Almost half my time has been bogged down  in administrative type stuff. Very little project work has happened so far. I find this very tedious. <br><br>Lots of time spent on video and audio which is tiring. I feel very &quot;watched&quot; on video as it&#x27;s hard to know who is looking where. Also difficult to time when to jump into or change a conversation. I miss the separation of work and life. <br><br>That&#x27;s all folks.

No one in my class makes less.<br><br>\\- As 100% field staff (which nobody wants to do, since living it a hotel everyweek is ... socially sacrificial) it feels very low. (I have confirmation from this from 5 other companies who offered me a position)<br><br>\\- They have a ridiculous clause on traveling. Say you have to stay on site for 4 weeks. You get payed to drive to the workplace and if you leave ... but if you wanna spent a weekend at home, you only get gas money and no time. One guy even told me, he fell sick and drove home only for the boss to tell him he won&#x27;t get payed for the 3,5h drive<br><br>\\- Every coworker I asked about how the boss handles pay raises, clenched his jaw tightly and then gave me a polite neutral answer. (Except the honest guy. He laughed at me with an &quot;If you bother him enough he raises. But don&#x27;t except the world&quot;)<br><br>So I basically made my mind up about looking for a new job.

I am a newbie data scientist and really don&#x27;t feel comfortable calling myself that anyway. <br><br>**The good**<br><br>In my nearly two months on the job, I have learned: <br><br>1) how pipelines work, specifically the targets package in R. To make for reproducibility and shorter run times on projects that branch (basically using a split-apply-combine approach that doesn&#x27;t rerun the same code when nothing has changed).<br><br>2) a little bit on the tidyverse. People love that here and I&#x27;m used to writing in base R. At least now I know what people are doing although it&#x27;s going to be hard switching to writing piped operations myself.<br><br>3) how to use containers, specifically docker. Useful for when you want code to not break down the road when packages and software get updated. Wish I had used this earlier. I guess if you code in python and manage your environments with anaconda you don&#x27;t need this (?) <br><br>4) how to run code and I/O data from a remote machine (high performance computer). And how to spin up a container with a .slurm script on the remote that opens up Rstudio. This way you can work as you normally would on your local. Really grateful for this.<br><br>5) a little bit more on git for version control. The part that I had missing was working collaboratively on branches, making pull requests, and managing conflicts-things I didn&#x27;t  really need to learn since all my previous projects had been solo ventures (gradschool and post grad work). <br><br>In the months to come, I will also have to learn how to correctly deliver data and project outputs on gitlab, Amazon s3 buckets, science base, etc. I will probably take a python course to be able to read other people&#x27;s code at the very least. Also, object oriented programming is on the wish list of things to learn. <br><br>**The bad**<br><br>Lots of acronyms floating around in discussions that make me lose the thread. The discussions seem really fast-paced and I can&#x27;t keep up. Some of it is probably because these discussions are not relevant to me, but I still have to listen and follow in case they are. Sometimes words are used interchangeably to refer to the same thing, which makes it hard to keep up too. <br><br>Reading other people&#x27;s code is difficult. But I have to say, my coworkers are rock stars and have very well-documented clean code. They are also generous with explaining what is happening and why with the code that they have written. <br><br>**The ugly**<br><br>I&#x27;m not sure if I can be of any help to projects since there are so many capable people around. Battling feelings of inadequacy and trying my best to catch up. <br><br>Almost half my time has been bogged down  in administrative type stuff. Very little project work has happened so far. I find this very tedious. <br><br>Lots of time spent on video and audio which is tiring. I feel very &quot;watched&quot; on video as it&#x27;s hard to know who is looking where. Also difficult to time when to jump into or change a conversation. I miss the separation of work and life. <br><br>That&#x27;s all folks. Thanks for reading.<br><br>**tl;dr** learned about pipe lining, tidy verse, containers, hpc, and more git stuff.

       "        <td>Hi all, recent grad here with 1.5 years of experience as a &quot;Machine Learning Engineer&quot;, except the actual duties of the role aren&#x27;t even close to that of an ML Engineer.<br><br>The role I&#x27;ve found myself in doesn&#x27;t involve much machine learning even though the job description and the manager&#x27;s description implied that it did. I&#x27;ve also been placed in a position where it&#x27;s become my job to perform physics simulations due to the experience I gained through my physics master&#x27;s degree. Further, the small amount of machine learning I&#x27;ve been a part of doesn&#x27;t involve training or deploying models. Instead, the usual practice my company has adopted is that we build a pip installable Python package with a command line interface and &quot;deploy&quot; the code by installing this on our customer&#x27;s computers.<br><br>Being my first job out of grad school, I jumped on the opportunity with no initial regrets and I&#x27;m treating this as a learning experience. I was definitely aware that this position wasn&#x27;t what it was advertised to be within a few weeks of starting the position, but with it being my first job and the uncertainty that the pandemic brought, I decided to ride it out until now.<br><br>Recently, I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s time to move on to another position that actually offers career development for future Machine Learning Engineer roles, except I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of difficulty in finding another position. Over the past year, I have been working weekends to update my portfolio that displays my current coding and machine learning capabilities, which definitely go beyond what&#x27;s expected of me at my job.<br><br>I&#x27;ve had quite a few interviews, including a technical interview with Amazon, so I don&#x27;t think my resume is lacking. I feel I&#x27;ve been able to put a positive spin on the small amount of machine learning that I&#x27;ve done at work while also trying to highlight the extra time I put in to make myself a more desirable candidate. However, I feel like I keep falling short when interviewers ask me about how we deploy models at my current position. I&#x27;ve done a small amount of work on my portfolio using restful APIs to show that I have the ability to do more than my job currently asks, but I feel like I&#x27;m hitting a wall and I&#x27;m not sure where to focus my efforts to help my situation. I would appreciate any advice that could be considered useful, or even just a sanity check to know that others have been in this position and moved to a role with more applicable responsibilities.<br><br>TL;DR:<br><br>First job after grad school shouldn&#x27;t actually be considered an ML Engineer role. Struggling with interviews because the experience I&#x27;ve gained isn&#x27;t applicable to positions that fit my current job title. Seeking advice to become a real ML Engineer.</td>\n",

Requests is great however, because the OpenSSL implementation used by Python or a venv is not the same as the system OpenSSL implementation you often run into an issue with projects - especially in corporate environments where they&#x27;ve rolled their own internal CA.  Even if the machine trusts the CA, Python/Requests throws an error because Python has its own openSSL implementation.<br><br>So normally the solution to this is to either hard code the path to the cert in code or to set an environmental variable with the same information (more on this on the Requests documentation page).  This gets cumbersome when you have layers of dependencies sitting on top of Requests.<br><br>So basically it would be great to have a simple library that could at the very least check for a self-signed certificate.

       "        <td>You must first choose a programming language if you want to work in the fields of data science and machine learning. This is crucial since it is necessary to understand the language in which the programmes will be executed. Python is one of the best options, but you can also learn other languages like C and C++. It is, however, a matter of personal preference.<br><br>We&#x27;ll look at the definition of Python as well as several resources for mastering the language. Python certification is also well-liked by programmers.<br><br># Python is a simple language to learn<br><br>Python is without a doubt the most widely utilised programming language for developing apps in many organisations. Here are a few reasons why Python is an excellent career choice:<br><br>Python has the most user-friendly syntax and readability of any programming language, making it perfect for both rookie and professional programmers. It&#x27;s also intuitive and straightforward to understand; in fact, it&#x27;s almost identical to regular English.<br><br>**Python supports a wide range of paradigms. On the other hand, the majority of users describe it as a very object-oriented programming language.**<br><br>* It&#x27;s a completely open-source and free programming language.<br>* There are hundreds of different systems and libraries from which to pick. Python frameworks simplify the development process.<br>* It saves you time by allowing you to replace the entire solution rapidly.<br><br># Let&#x27;s look at some learning materials for Python programming:<br><br>**Udemy**<br><br>This site&#x27;s initial piece of coursework will be a Python crash course. The topics of syntax and data structures will be discussed. Following the completion of the chapters, you will study data science and machine learning libraries. Just a few examples include Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas.<br><br>Josh Portilla will be your tutor as well. He also serves as the CEO of Pierian Data Inc., where he oversees data science. In addition to the online programmes, you can contact the teacher for in-person data science and [Python programming](https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/course/python-programming-crash-course/) training. Many personnel from prominent organisations attend his training courses, including Cigna, electric, Suisse, the New York Times, McKinsey, and others.<br><br>* During the session, you will learn important concepts such as:<br>* The tradeoff between bias and variance in cross-validation.<br>* Processes of natural language<br>* Suggestions for systems<br><br>**There are a variety of machine learning algorithms to choose from.**<br><br>2.**Teaching Python with TalkPython**<br><br>Students study Python through project-based learning in this course. You&#x27;ll learn the Python syntax as well as how to execute tasks in Python. Furthermore, once you&#x27;ve completed the course, you&#x27;ll be able to work independently on your Python projects.<br><br>During the initial study, you will learn how to construct ten applications. The training is affordable, costing only $69 for lifetime access. However, we recommend that you check the material and summary before paying for the course. When you finish the course, see if they offer Python programming certification.<br><br>3. **Coursera is a platform for online learning**<br><br>It&#x27;s been running since April 2012, and Andrew NG, a well-known machine learning instructor, is in charge of it. Coursera has partnered with a number of important universities around the world. These schools also provide online certifications, degrees, and courses.<br><br>4**. Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Development using IBM Python**<br><br>Your IBM trainer is Joseph Santarcangelo, a Ph.D. Data Scientist at IBM. This platform brings together a wide range of organisations to exchange their knowledge and skills on the subject. Furthermore, this course is suitable for novices and serves as an introduction to Python. Students with no prior programming expertise can also start with this course and learn how to programme in Python. The course covers Python principles, data structures, data assessment, and other subjects. In addition, you will learn about collections and APIs.<br><br>Machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, dimension reduction, and clustering will also be covered. Aside from that, this course will teach you about typical models such as Root Mean Squared Error, Train/Test Split, and Random Forests.<br><br>IBM is concentrating on Python&#x27;s practical applications. As a result, I urge you to think about how machine learning technologies are changing our environment on a regular basis.<br><br>5. **Python programming tutorials on Socratica**<br><br>Socratica is a well-known YouTube channel for being one of the best locations to learn Python programming. They deliver programming lectures in a manner that is as engaging and effective as watching a good Netflix show. Python is well-known for its data science and machine learning capabilities. Python&#x27;s libraries can be used for both front-end and back-end development. Two of the best programmes for quickly constructing AI systems are Scikit-learn and Tensorflow.<br><br>6.**Codecademy**<br><br>One of the most popular places to learn data science, Python, and machine learning in general is Codecademy. This platform will teach you about a range of skill path courses. Despite the fact that most of their specialisations are similar to those offered by Coursera, the latter&#x27;s curriculum is substantially shorter. Its training materials are designed for persons with no prior experience and are beginner-friendly all the way up to expert level. Users can also access crucial learning tools like Codecademy blogs and other resources.<br><br># The following are the offered courses on the platform:<br><br>* Python 3 is being thoroughly investigated<br>* Data visualisation is done with Python<br>* Data Cleaning Technique in Python<br>* A machine learning model is built using Python<br><br># Conclusion<br><br>The resources listed above provide some of the best training for both beginners and [python expert](https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/course/python-programming-crash-course/). However, before you spend your money and time on the courses, we encourage that you learn everything you can about them. Also, resist the urge to sign up for many classes at the same time. But, no matter the road you take, be sure you stick with it until the finish. A good platform will enable you to put everything you&#x27;ve learnt in their course into practise. Furthermore, avoid getting caught up in the Python vs. R debate because it will just serve to distract you and waste your time.<br><br>If you want to learn about upcoming technologies, the Global Tech Council is the place to go.</td>\n",

       "        <td>I&#x27;ll preface this by saying that I&#x27;m a big believer in higher education. Whenever someone asks me how to get into data science, I tell them to look into getting a degree in a related field. I did my undergrad in psychology at a STEM-heavy university, which is how I first got introduced to research methods and statistics. I then went on to do a masters in business analytics. This was also a very stats heave program with only a little bit of programming and ml mixed in so I&#x27;m mostly self taught in python, r, and sql. I don&#x27;t design and implement ml algorithms but when it comes to the day to day work of data analysis, hypothesis testing, model training/validation/production, and reporting, I consider myself pretty well qualified.  <br><br>Lately I&#x27;ve been thinking more and more about going back to school to do a PhD. I like my work but I know I&#x27;ll get bored if I don&#x27;t keep progressing. Also, as the market becomes more and more saturated, I&#x27;m afraid that my educational background might soon become a barrier of entry for landing the types of jobs I want. For those with PhDs, does your degree give you a deeper level of insight that your colleagues with lower level degrees lack? <br><br>I realize that every program is different  and that &quot;data science&quot; is a blanket term that covers a lot of different skill sets but I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s something you get from serving as a TA and a research assistant and completing a dissertation that those who haven&#x27;t been through this process inherently lack. I ask because I feel that my education and industry experience makes me well-qualified for a lot of different types of jobs in the industry and I can pick up new skills relatively quickly but I&#x27;m also aware of the fact that it&#x27;s impossible to know what you don&#x27;t know or to understand what you don&#x27;t understand.</td>\n",

    "Overall, there were not many posts with negative sentiments; the datascience subreddit was the only one that had more negative posts than neutral. Also the NLP subreddit was the only one which had predominantly neutral posts. However when looking at the boxplots, we see that MachineLearning actually seems to have the greatest distribution of compound scores, especially with its negative posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing I discovered was that the NLP and LanguageTechnology subreddits did not have tags with their posts. I found that unusual, but I compared the tags of the remaining three subreddits. Python had the greatest variety of topics, spread out across 8 different tags, whereas MachineLearnings posts all fell into Discussion, Research, Project, or News. Overall, Discussion was by far the most common topic.\n",
