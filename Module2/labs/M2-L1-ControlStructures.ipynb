    "## Condition\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:right\"><a href=\"#Table-of-Contents\">[toc]</a></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "A condition is a boolean expression, which can be either `True` or `False`. The term `condition` is used extensively below; many of the following control statements use logical conditionals or relational conditionals. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `condition` is defined thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<condition> = True | False | <Evaluatable to True> | <Evaluatable to False>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A boolean expression can be formed in many way; two of them are as follows (also covered in Module 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Relational operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational operators or comparison operators produce boolean values. These operators include `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`. E.g., if two variables `x`, and `y` has values 5 and 7, respectively, then the expression `x == y` will produce `False` value. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common error is to use a single equal sign (`=`) instead of a double equal sign (`==`). Remember that `=` is an assignment operator and `==` is a relational operator. There is no such thing as `=<` or `=>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators are used to combine expressions. There are three logical operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`. E.g., the expression `not(x < 5 and x < 10)` will produce `True` and `False` for `x=6` and `x=3`, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other expressions that boolean values are identity operators and membership operators. See [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp) to learn more. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Truth values vs Truthy and Falsy values\n",
    "\n",
    "The above discussion of boolean expression is related to truth values. But there is another important concept in Python, which is truthy or falsy values, which can also be appear in condtion (we will see such examples in the following subsection). In Python, any individual values can evaluate to either True or False, and these individual values may NOT be a resultant of a boolean or relational expression. Any object can be tested for truth value. E.g., if x is numeric variable and `x=0`, then `x` will evaluated as `False`, and if `x` is any non-zero value then `x` will be evaluated to `True`. An empty list (`[]`) or dictionary (`{}`) is evaluated to be False; whereas, a non-empty list or dictionary is evaluated to be True. Read 1.A to learn more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, almost all statements, function calls, and values can be evaluated to True or False. Refer to the Python documentation for more, or simply try `bool(<expression>)` to see if it will work."

    "Sometimes we need to exit the loop if a condition is met. E.g., we are searching a word within a list of words using a for loop. If the word is present in this list and the word is not the last word in the list, then we will find a match before reaching the last word of the list. In this scenario, if we continue iterating over the list after the match is found, then it is not an efficient program. A break statement helps us to exit early.\n",
