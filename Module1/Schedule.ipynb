    "# Python : A Swiss Army Knife for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.  Python is an interpreted language, so you can simply write and run: you do not need to compile your code.  Additionally, Python environments have a kernel execution giving you a command prompt to type in Python commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this program, we will use Python via the JupyterHub environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the DSA JupyterHub environment, you will not need to worry about software installations or library compatibilities.  We have taken care of that for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "With this boot camp, you can read through the modules and work through a series of Python Notebooks.  There are two sets of notebooks.  One set is from an open source of simple Python lessons. The other set is the end of module learning exercises developed to lead you into data science readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- #### Note: There is no grading of these materials.  You have access to the solutions for the labs and the practices. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of having both labs, practices, and exercies in the boot camps will help you learn what to expect in regular MU DSA courses."
