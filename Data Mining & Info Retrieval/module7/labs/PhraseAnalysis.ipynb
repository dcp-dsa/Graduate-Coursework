now and     Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing  not a bad thing  Only  stupid  people  or fools  would think that it is bad  We      Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed  Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results  Voting machines not touched  Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place The Republican National Committee had strong defense  Happy Birthday

Great Wall  for sake of speed   will be paid back by Mexico later  So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers  What is going on

be careful  like the 116  hike in Arizona  Also  deductibles are so high that it is practically useless  Don t let the Schumer clowns out of this web    Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster  with its poor coverage and massive premium increases       things they did and said  like giving the questions to the debate to H   A total double standard  Media

than Hillary on the loss  I would have done even better in the election  if that is possible  if the winner was based on popular vote   but would campaign differently Campaigning to win the Electoral

thought that  CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however  since election  they are worse  The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory   306    CNN is so embarrassed by their total   100   support of Hillary Clinton  and yet her loss in a landslide  that they don t know what to do    sdcritic    HighonHillcrest  jeffzeleny  CNN There is NO QUESTION THAT  voterfraud did take place  and in favor of  CorruptHillary      FiIibuster   jeffzeleny Pathetic   you have no sufficient evidence that Donald Trump did not suffer from voter fraud  shame  Bad reporter    JoeBowman12   jeffzeleny just another generic CNN part time wannabe journalist      CNN still doesn t get it  They will never learn    HighonHillcrest   jeffzeleny what PROOF do u have DonaldTrump did not suffer from millions of FRAUD votes  Journalist  Do your job   CNN  Just met with General Petraeus  was very impressed  If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people  the Cuban American people and the U S  as a whole  I will terminate deal  Serious voter fraud in Virginia  New Hampshire and California   so why isn t the media reporting on this  Serious bias   big problem  states instead of the 15 states that I visited  I would have won even more easily and convincingly  but smaller states are forgotten   It would have been much easier for me to win the so called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4   In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide  I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally Trump is going to be our President  We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead   So much time and money will be spent   same result  Sad this election  That is a direct threat to our democracy   She then said   We have to accept the results and look to the future  Donald    of position   Then  separately she stated   He said something truly horrifying     he refused to say that he would respect the results of    during a general election  I  for one  am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind    and fair elections  We ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them  and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a   Hillary s debate answer on delay   That is horrifying  That is not the way our democracy works  Been around for 240 years  We ve had free    Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in  Nothing will change The Democrats  when they incorrectly thought they were going to win  asked that the election night tabulation be accepted  Not so anymore  The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated  amp  demoralized Dems Fidel Castro is dead  I am working hard  even on Thanksgiving  trying to get Carrier A C  Company to stay in the U S   Indiana   MAKING PROGRESS   Will know soon  Happy Thanksgiving to everyone  We will  together  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  Let us give thanks for all that we have  and let us boldly face the exciting new frontiers that lie ahead  Happy Th   Bus crash in Tennessee so sad  amp  so terrible  Condolences to all family members and loved ones  These beautiful children will be remembered  I am seriously considering Dr  Ben Carson as the head of HUD  I ve gotten to know him well  he s a greatly talented person who loves people  The meeting with the  nytimes is back on at 12 30 today  Look forward to it   Jeff Sessions  a Fitting Selection for Attorney General     President elect Donald J  Trump s CIA Director Garners Praise    Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years  The failing  nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high  I can fully understand that   but why announce  Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the  nytimes  In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone  I cancelled today s meeting with the failing  nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment  Not nice Many people would like to see  Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States  He would do a great job  Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world Only the crooked media makes this a big deal    transition2017 update and policy plans for the first 100 days    I have always had a good relationship with Chuck Schumer  He is far smarter than Harry R and has the ability to get things done  Good news  General James  Mad Dog  Mattis  who is being considered for Secretary of Defense  was very impressive yesterday  A true General s General  I watched parts of  nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night  It is a totally one sided  biased show   nothing funny at all  Equal time for us  Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  The cast and producers of Hamilton  which I hear is highly overrated  should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior The Theater must always be a safe and special place The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man  Mike Pence  Apologize  Our wonderful future V P  Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton  cameras blazing This should not happen  The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U  Too bad  I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country  Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky  I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me  Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford  Chairman of Ford  who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky   no Mexico My transition team  which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job  will be seeing many great candidates today   MAGA Australia  New Zealand  and more  I am always available to them   nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me  I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing  nytimes said  Russia  U K   China  Saudi Arabia  Japan  The failing  nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition  It is going so smoothly  Also  I have spoken to many foreign leaders  I am not trying to get  top level security clearance  for my children  This was a typically false news story  Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions  I am the only one who knows who the finalists are  The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states  including the smaller ones  into play  Campaigning is much different  If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in  N Y  Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily The debates  especially the second and third  plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies  plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS  gave us the win  I will be interviewed on  60Minutes tonight after the NFL game   7 00 P M  Enjoy  The  nytimes states today that DJT believes  more countries should acquire nuclear weapons   How dishonest are they  I never said this  Governor John Kasich of the GREAT  GREAT  GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win  The people of Ohio were incredible  Jeb Bush  George W and George H W  all called to express their best wishes on the win  Very nice  Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win  Very nice  The  nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me  I wonder if it will change   doubt it  Wow  the  nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the  Trump phenomena  This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans  We will unite and we will win  win  win  Today we express our deepest gratitude to all those who have served in our armed forces   ThankAVet   Busy day planned in New York  Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government  Love the fact that the

will exclaim it to be incredible  Highly overrated  You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is  and neither does ISIS  a good thing   Please get your facts straight   thanks   megynkelly For the

good day  If you listen to the other two  they are fawning  What a difference Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton  All of that work  energy and money  and nothing to show for it  Waste of time  Elizabeth Warren  often referred to as Pocahontas  just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary  who she always hated  Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution  We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs  If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party  they have no future  I know more about Cory than he knows about himself  I was at  FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing   He asked if he could have pictures taken with me  I said fine  He then trashes on air  Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold  He got NOTHING for all of the time  energy and money  The V P  a joke  While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people  we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers  Clinton betrayed Bernie voters  Kaine supports TPP  is in pocket of Wall Street  and backed Iraq War  Thank you OHIO   TrumpPence16   Thank you Roanoke  Virginia  be back soon

Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess  But fear not  the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn  Here we go again with another Clinton scandal  and e mails yet  can you believe   Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in  B never had a chance  Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her  servant  was doing at the DNC   they just got caught  that s all  They laughed at Bernie  If Bernie Sanders  after seeing the just released e mails  continues to look exhausted and done  then his legacy will never be the same  Thank you   MakeAmericaGreatAgain   Hillary was involved in the e mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened  How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e mails  using even religion  against Bernie  The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e mails  which should never have been written  stupid   because Putin likes me Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes  No way they are going to fix America s problems  ISIS  amp  all others laughing  The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good  but for the final night  my speech  great  Thank you  The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that  after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory  she s out  The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing  E mails say the rigged system is alive  amp  well  Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength  I don t believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook  Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top  DWS  Too bad Bernie flamed out If the Republican Convention had blown up with e mails  resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player   Bernie   media would go wild The  CNN panels are so one sided  almost all against Trump   FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher  Don t watch CNN  I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated  The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted  no energy left  Today proves what I have always known  that  Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one  not Debbie Wasserman Shultz   DWStweets   Sorry folks  but Bernie Sanders is exhausted  just can t go on any longer  He is trying to dismiss the new e mails and DNC disrespect  SAD  There is no longer a Bernie Sanders  political revolution   He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure wants it all to end  An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates  Looks like the Bernie people will fight  If not  their BLOOD  SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time  Kaine stands for opposite  Wow  President Obama s brother  Malik  just announced that he is voting for me  Was probably treated badly by president like everybody else  Bernie Sanders started off strong  but with the selection of Kaine for V P   is ending really weak  So much for a movement  TOTAL DISRESPECT The Crooked Hillary V P  choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters  Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H   MakeAmericaGreatAgain  TrumpPence16     NancyNielsenn   realDonaldTrump Dinesh
