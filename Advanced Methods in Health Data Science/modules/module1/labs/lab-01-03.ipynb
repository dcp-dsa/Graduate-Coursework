    "# Module 1 Lab 3 - Refresher on two-way contingency table analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will see how to compare frequencies broken out by two variables that we have obtained from sampling a single population (a test of independence), or two sets of frequencies collected from two different populations (a test of homogeneity).  This method is known as a contingency table or a two-way frequency table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first section of this lab, we will take a look at data that was used to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine against polio developed in the mid 1950's by Dr. Jonas Salk.  This kind of contingency table analysis is frequently used in heath data analysis and survey analysis.  We will perform a test of independence, which is to say that of the two groups of data that are being compared, there is no association (dependency) between the row and column variables in the contingency table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second section of the lab, we will perform a test of homogeneity.  This test is used to determine if two populations have the same proportions across a given. As the name implies, we can use this to see of the two populations are homogenous with regards to the variable.  The procedure is the same as for the test of independence, but the interpretation differs."

    "\n",
    "Because the p value is less than 0.05, we reject the Null hypothesis that the rows and columns are independent.  In other words, we reject that whether a person gets the Salk vaccine or a placebo is independent of whether they develop polio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deeper understanding\n",
    "We get the output of expected frequencies if the Null hypothesis were true.  The expected frequencies represent equal probabilities for each cell, and form the basis of the Null hypothesis: that the frequencies are independent, and therefore the same.  We can interpret the expected frequencies this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "There were 401,974 people in the study, and 148 contracted polio (these are the facts irrespective of whether they got the vaccine or a placebo).  If getting the vaccine or not is independent of devloping polio, then we would have expected about 74 people in the treatment group to contract polio, and about 74 people in the plaebo group to contract polio (it's the total number of people who did contract polio divided by 2). Additionally, if 74 people had contracted polio with the vaccine, we would have expected the number of people not contracting polio to be 200,671 (subtract an additional 41 people (74-33) from the no polio group since they moved to the poio group), and for 74 people in the placebo group contracting polio, we would have expected 201,155 to not contract polio (again moving people from one group to the other to balance the total).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, it was observed that only 33 people in the treatment group developed polio, and 115 in the placebo group developed polio.  Also 200,712 in the treatment group did not develop polio, and 201,114 in the placebo group did not develop polio.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These differences were found to be significant, and therefore led to rejection of  the Null hypothesis.\n"

    "Assumption 1 is met, because we cannot have a physician with two differrent levels of experience.

Assumption 3 is met (level of experience and uses calculators are the two variables), and finally assumption 4 is met due to the nature of the survey administraion being to a random sample of physicians.\n",
