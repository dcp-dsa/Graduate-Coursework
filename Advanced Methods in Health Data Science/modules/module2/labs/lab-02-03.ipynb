    "# Module 2 Lab 3 - Generalized Estimating Equations for Repeated Categorical Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "In lab 2 we looked at the Repeated Measures ANOVA approach for analyzing repeated data.  One of the assumptions for ANOVARM is that we have continuous measures.  If instead, our measures are categorical in nature, then we cannot apply ANOVARM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) is an extension to the idea of Generalized Linear Models (GLM), to which class linear regression belongs.  In GLM, one of the assumptions is the independence of data.  In a study design where data are collected longitudinally, this assumption would not be true, as measurements taken from one subject at a point in time are related to other measurements taken on that subject either before or after.  So _within subject_ measurements are not independent, but _across subjects_ might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "GEE is a model that accounts for the within-subjects relationships, and also can handle categorical (both nominal and ordinal) dependent variables, as well as continuous.  Using GEE is an approach to analysis of repeated categorical measurements that we will explore in this lab for categorical dependent variables."

    "## Specifications for the GEE\n",
    "When modeling the GEE, one must make a determination about how time points are related, this is known as the dependence or correlation structure.  There are a number of possible options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Independent - the measurements at each time point are independent of each other.  For modeling repeated measures data, this option is not suitable because we would expect some correlation between the data at different time points\n",
    "1. Exchangeable - the correlation between two time points within a subject are equal for _any_ two timepoints\n",
    "1. Autoregressive - successive time points are correlated to prior time points, and the correlation weakens the farther apart the two time points are\n",
    "1. Unstructured - the correlation is estimated for any two time point combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the data will help you choose an appropriate correlation structure, but the model will likely not fail if you choose the wrong one.  In the worst case, the structure will not converge and you will see a warning, in which case that correlation structure should not be used, and the model is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation for the available correlation structures is [here](https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/gee.html#module-reference).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this data, we will choose Exchangeable, as it's reasonable to assume that from year to year wheezing in a child may be equally correlated. Autoregressive is another potential option that can be tried, as it is also reasonable to assume that prior wheezing my be correlated to future wheezing in a child.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying the distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to select a distribution that fits the dependent variable.  Recall from basic statistics that different types of variables follow different random distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. continuous - Normal distribution\n",
    "1. binary - Bernoulli distribution\n",
    "1. counts/categorical - Poisson distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "We are primarily interested in using GEE for categorical or binary response varaibles, so we'll be choosing Bernoulli or Poisson in repeated categorical analysis.  In this specific case, our response is binary, so we choose Bernoulli.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying the formula\n",
    "The formula is specified as you would a regression or GLM model, with one dependent (or endogenous) variable, and one or more independent (or exogenous) variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Putting it all together\n",
    "We plan to run a GEE model, using the Binomial distribution and a correlation structure that assumes Exchangeable correlation.  The dependent variable is `resp`, which is binary, and the independent variables are `age`, which is categorical, and `smoke`, which is binary.  Each subject is grouped by the `id` column, whch we will also need to specify.  \n",
