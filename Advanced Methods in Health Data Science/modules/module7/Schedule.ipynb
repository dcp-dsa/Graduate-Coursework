    "In the last module, we studied Python methods for data mining and supervised learning.  In supervised learning, you have a target (dependent variable), and you're training a model to learn that target from the independent variables.  In unsupervised learning, there is no target.  What you try to accomplish with unsupervised learning is to see if the data are naturally grouped together by their features, and then use that information to make predictions or for other purposes.\n",

    "In this module we will take a look at clustering based models for unsupervised learning, including KMeans, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical.  You may have used the KMeans algorithm for binning continuous data into categories, or used the DBSCAN algorithm to identify outliers.  Here we will see how they work to identify clusters that serve a useful purpose.\n"
