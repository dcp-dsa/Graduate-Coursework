    "# Module 5 Lab 1 - Accessing data via FHIR\n",
    "[FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) is a standard to provide an EMR agnostic interface to data contained in an electronic medical record.  The major EMR systems such as Epic and Cerner have provided FHIR api access to their systems, and as of 2020 the ONC has mandated a portion of the FHIR interface (the bulk data API) be part of any certified EHR.  \n",
    "\n",
    "FHIR can be used to develop clinical decision support modules that can run on any EMR platform, in conjunction with [SMART](https://smarthealthit.org/).  SMART provides the framework for embedding an app into an EMR.  Apps can be developed by anyone, and when based on the FHIR API, can be deployed to any system that support the FHIR standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have developed a predictive model for patients, then the dissemination of that model can be done via a \"SMART on FHIR\" app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Development of web-based SMART applications is beyond the scope of this course and usually beyond the scope of what a data scientist would do, but accessing data through a FHIR interface from an EHR is a relevant topic that we will explore in this module."

    "You can find our patient [here](https://patient-browser.smarthealthit.org/?config=r3#/) by choosing \"Advanced Mode\" in the upper right corner for search, and inputing the above search criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fhirclient package is very object oriented.  Each item retrieved by the package is an object that must be interpreted properly to be of use.  The `Patient.read` method returns a `fhirclient.models.patient.Patient` object.  To get data from it we use attributes and methods on that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can get the `birthDate` using an attribute, but priniting that reveals it is also an object of type `fhirclient.models.fhirdate.FHIRDate`.  To get a human readable form of the date, we have to use an attribute of that object, `isostring`.  We can also get a python `Date` object as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "`patient.name` is an array of patient names.  This patient has one alias.  We access with array notation, to get the first (and only) alias.  Again we notice that it is an object of type `fhirclient.models.humanname.HumanName`.  We can call a method on the smart api to get a formatted version of the name using `smart.human_name()`.  We can also access individual components of the name.  Notice that the attribute `given` is also an array.  This accounts for cultures that give more than a first and middle name, which can commonly happen in Spanish, Arabic, and many other cultures or regions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation on object types can be found here: http://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-py/annotated.html.  You can use the search function to find the class documentation. HINT: Only search on the last part of the fully qualified object type, i.e. `Patient`, in order to get results.\n",
