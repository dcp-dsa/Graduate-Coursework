    "In this module we will cover several aspects of data sceince for medical imaging.  The first topic is the concept of medical images as a data source, the DICOM image format, and basic image manipulation using Python.  The second topic is the use of Convolution Neural Networks for image classification, and a specific application to tumor identification in MRI images.  Image classification for any purpose is highly specialized and specific, so this is meant to be an introduction to a leading technique and concept for \n"
