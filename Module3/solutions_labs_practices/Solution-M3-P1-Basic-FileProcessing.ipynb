      "\n",
      "In the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the\n",

      " on the west the Mississippi, and on the north an irregular line\n",

      "\n",
      " will thus find, in regard to its safety, an inducement to make some\n",

      " would, in fact, be essentially different; I mean where the exercise\n",

      "\n",
      " interferences in the POLICY of any branch of administration, but\n",
      "\n",
      " would not imply any direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of\n",

      "\n",
      " jurisdiction in the federal government may be exemplified by the\n",
      "\n",
      " following instances: The last clause but one in the eighth section\n",
      "\n",
      " of the first article provides expressly that Congress shall exercise\n",
      "\n",
      " ``EXCLUSIVE LEGISLATION'' over the district to be appropriated as\n",
      "\n",
      " the seat of government. This answers to the first case. The first\n",
      "\n",
      " clause of the same section empowers Congress ``TO LAY AND COLLECT\n",
      "\n",
      " TAXES, DUTIES, IMPOSTS AND EXCISES''; and the second clause of the\n",

      "\n",
      " without the consent of Congress, LAY ANY IMPOSTS OR DUTIES ON\n",
      "\n",
      " IMPORTS OR EXPORTS, except for the purpose of executing its\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      " Union to lay duties on imports and exports, with the particular\n",
      "\n",
      " exception mentioned; but this power is abridged by another clause,\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      " exported from any State; in consequence of which qualification, it\n",
      "\n",
      " now only extends to the DUTIES ON IMPORTS. This answers to the\n",

      " that Congress shall have power ``to establish an UNIFORM RULE of\n",

      "\n",
      " a plain and conclusive argument to the contrary is to be deduced\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      " Why not in the first instance omit that ambiguous power, and rely\n",
      "\n",
      " upon the latter resource? Two solid answers may be given. The\n",
      "\n",
      " first is, that the exercise of that power, if convenient, will be\n",
      "\n",
      " preferable, because it will be more effectual; and it is impossible\n",
      "\n",
      " to prove in theory, or otherwise than by the experiment, that it\n",
      "\n",
      " cannot be advantageously exercised. The contrary, indeed, appears\n",
      "\n",
      " most probable. The second answer is, that the existence of such a\n",
      "\n",
      " power in the Constitution will have a strong influence in giving\n",
      "\n",
      " efficacy to requisitions. When the States know that the Union can\n",
      "\n",
      " apply itself without their agency, it will be a powerful motive for\n",
      "\n",
      " exertion on their part.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the interference of the revenue laws of the Union, and of\n",
      "\n",
      " its members, we have already seen that there can be no clashing or\n",
      "\n",
      " repugnancy of authority. The laws cannot, therefore, in a legal\n",
      "\n",
      " sense, interfere with each other; and it is far from impossible to\n",
      "\n",
      " avoid an interference even in the policy of their different systems.\n",
      "\n",
      " An effectual expedient for this purpose will be, mutually, to\n",
      "\n",
      " abstain from those objects which either side may have first had\n",
      "\n",
      " recourse to. As neither can CONTROL the other, each will have an\n",
      "\n",
      " obvious and sensible interest in this reciprocal forbearance. And\n",
      "\n",
      " where there is an IMMEDIATE common interest, we may safely count\n",
      "\n",
      " upon its operation. When the particular debts of the States are\n",
      "\n",
      " done away, and their expenses come to be limited within their\n",
      "\n",
      " natural compass, the possibility almost of interference will vanish.\n",

      "\n",
      " taxations, and the frightful forms of odious and oppressive\n",

      "\n",
      "As to the first point, there are two cases in which there can be\n",
      "\n",
      " no room for double sets of officers: one, where the right of\n",
      "\n",
      " imposing the tax is exclusively vested in the Union, which applies\n",

      "\n",
      " fallen under any State regulation or provision, which may be\n",
      "\n",
      " applicable to a variety of objects. In other cases, the probability\n",
      "\n",
      " is that the United States will either wholly abstain from the\n",
      "\n",

      " will save expense in the collection, and will best avoid any\n",
      "\n",
      " occasion of disgust to the State governments and to the people. At\n",
      "\n",
      " all events, here is a practicable expedient for avoiding such an\n",

      " certain road to the accomplishment of its aim would be to employ the\n",

      "\n",
      "the power surrendered by the people is first divided between two\n",
      "\n",
      "distinct governments, and then the portion allotted to each\n",
      "\n",
      "subdivided among distinct and separate departments. Hence a\n",
      "\n",
      "double security arises to the rights of the people. The different\n",
      "\n",
      "governments will control each other, at the same time that each\n",
      "\n",
      "will be controlled by itself. Second. It is of great importance\n",
      "\n",
      "in a republic not only to guard the society against the\n",
      "\n",
      "oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the society\n",
      "\n",
      "against the injustice of the other part. Different interests\n",

      "community independent of the majority that is, of the society\n",

      "itself; the other, by comprehending in the society so many\n",

      "separate descriptions of citizens as will render an unjust\n",
      "\n",
      "combination of a majority of the whole very improbable, if not\n",

      "impracticable. The first method prevails in all governments\n",
      "\n",
      "possessing an hereditary or self-appointed authority. This, at\n",
      "\n",
      "best, is but a precarious security; because a power independent\n",
      "\n",
      "of the society may as well espouse the unjust views of the major,\n",
      "\n",
      "as the rightful interests of the minor party, and may possibly be\n",

      " indispensable.'' A common government, with powers equal to its\n",
      "\n",
      " objects, is called for by the voice, and still more loudly by the\n",
      "\n",
      " political situation, of America. A government founded on principles\n",

      "\n",
      " contemplate rather the advantageous consequences which may qualify\n",
      "\n",
      " the sacrifice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this spirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote allowed\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      " of sovereignty remaining in the individual States, and an instrument\n",
      "\n",
      " for preserving that residuary sovereignty. So far the equality\n",

      " possible expedient, against an improper consolidation of the States\n",

      " into one simple republic.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      " instances be injurious as well as beneficial; and that the peculiar\n",

      "\n",
      " danger. But as the larger States will always be able, by their\n",
      "\n",
      " power over the supplies, to defeat unreasonable exertions of this\n",
      "\n",
      " prerogative of the lesser States, and as the faculty and excess of\n",
      "\n",
      " law-making seem to be the diseases to which our governments are most\n",
      "\n",
      " liable, it is not impossible that this part of the Constitution may\n",

      " be more convenient in practice than it appears to many in\n",
      "\n",
      " contemplation.\n",
      "\n",
      "IV. The number of senators, and the duration of their\n",
      "\n",
      " appointment, come next to be considered. In order to form an\n",
      "\n",
      " accurate judgment on both of these points, it will be proper to\n",
      "\n",
      " inquire into the purposes which are to be answered by a senate; and\n",
      "\n",
      " in order to ascertain these, it will be necessary to review the\n",
      "\n",
      " inconveniences which a republic must suffer from the want of such an\n",
      "\n",
      " institution.\n",
      "\n",
      "First. It is a misfortune incident to republican\n",
      "\n",
      " government, though in a less degree than to other governments, that\n",
      "\n",
      " those who administer it may forget their obligations to their\n",
      "\n",
      " constituents, and prove unfaithful to their important trust. In\n",
      "\n",
      " this point of view, a senate, as a second branch of the legislative\n",
      "\n",
      " assembly, distinct from, and dividing the power with, a first, must\n",
      "\n",
      " be in all cases a salutary check on the government. It doubles the\n",
      "\n",
      " security to the people, by requiring the concurrence of two distinct\n",
      "\n",
      " bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy, where the ambition or\n",
      "\n",
      " corruption of one would otherwise be sufficient. This is a\n",
      "\n",
      " precaution founded on such clear principles, and now so well\n",
      "\n",
      " understood in the United States, that it would be more than\n",
      "\n",
      " superfluous to enlarge on it. I will barely remark, that as the\n",
      "\n",
      " improbability of sinister combinations will be in proportion to the\n",
      "\n",
      " dissimilarity in the genius of the two bodies, it must be politic to\n",
      "\n",
      " distinguish them from each other by every circumstance which will\n",
      "\n",
      " consist with a due harmony in all proper measures, and with the\n",
      "\n",
      " genuine principles of republican government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated\n",
      "\n",
      " by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to\n",
      "\n",
      " the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced by\n",
      "\n",
      " factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions.\n",
      "\n",
      " Examples on this subject might be cited without number; and from\n",
      "\n",
      " proceedings within the United States, as well as from the history of\n",
      "\n",
      " other nations. But a position that will not be contradicted, need\n",
      "\n",
      " not be proved. All that need be remarked is, that a body which is\n",
      "\n",
      " to correct this infirmity ought itself to be free from it, and\n",
      "\n",
      " consequently ought to be less numerous. It ought, moreover, to\n",
      "\n",
      " possess great firmness, and consequently ought to hold its authority\n",
      "\n",
      " by a tenure of considerable duration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly. Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in\n",
      "\n",
      " a want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of\n",
      "\n",
      " legislation. It is not possible that an assembly of men called for\n",
      "\n",
      " the most part from pursuits of a private nature, continued in\n",
      "\n",
      " appointment for a short time, and led by no permanent motive to\n",
      "\n",
      " devote the intervals of public occupation to a study of the laws,\n",
      "\n",
      " the affairs, and the comprehensive interests of their country,\n",
      "\n",
      " should, if left wholly to themselves, escape a variety of important\n",
      "\n",
      " errors in the exercise of their legislative trust. It may be\n",
      "\n",
      " affirmed, on the best grounds, that no small share of the present\n",
      "\n",
      " embarrassments of America is to be charged on the blunders of our\n",
      "\n",
      " governments; and that these have proceeded from the heads rather\n",
      "\n",
      " than the hearts of most of the authors of them. What indeed are all\n",
      "\n",
      " the repealing, explaining, and amending laws, which fill and\n",
      "\n",
      " disgrace our voluminous codes, but so many monuments of deficient\n",
      "\n",
      " wisdom; so many impeachments exhibited by each succeeding against\n",
      "\n",
      " each preceding session; so many admonitions to the people, of the\n",
      "\n",
      " value of those aids which may be expected from a well-constituted\n",
      "\n",
      " senate?\n",
      "\n",
      "A good government implies two things: first, fidelity to the\n",
      "\n",
      " object of government, which is the happiness of the people;\n",
      "\n",
      " secondly, a knowledge of the means by which that object can be best\n",
      "\n",
      " attained. Some governments are deficient in both these qualities;\n",
      "\n",
      " most governments are deficient in the first. I scruple not to\n",
      "\n",
      " assert, that in American governments too little attention has been\n",
      "\n",
      " paid to the last. The federal Constitution avoids this error; and\n",
      "\n",
      " what merits particular notice, it provides for the last in a mode\n",
      "\n",
      " which increases the security for the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourthly. The mutability in the public councils arising\n",
      "\n",
      " from a rapid succession of new members, however qualified they may\n",
      "\n",
      " be, points out, in the strongest manner, the necessity of some\n",
      "\n",
      " stable institution in the government. Every new election in the\n",
      "\n",
      " States is found to change one half of the representatives. From\n",
      "\n",
      " this change of men must proceed a change of opinions; and from a\n",
      "\n",
      " change of opinions, a change of measures. But a continual change\n",
      "\n",
      " even of good measures is inconsistent with every rule of prudence\n",
      "\n",
      " and every prospect of success. The remark is verified in private\n",
      "\n",
      " life, and becomes more just, as well as more important, in national\n",
      "\n",
      " transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "To trace the mischievous effects of a mutable government would\n",
      "\n",
      " fill a volume. I will hint a few only, each of which will be\n",
      "\n",
      " perceived to be a source of innumerable others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, it forfeits the respect and confidence of\n",
      "\n",
      " other nations, and all the advantages connected with national\n",
      "\n",
      " character. An individual who is observed to be inconstant to his\n",
      "\n",
      " plans, or perhaps to carry on his affairs without any plan at all,\n",
      "\n",
      " is marked at once, by all prudent people, as a speedy victim to his\n",
      "\n",
      " own unsteadiness and folly. His more friendly neighbors may pity\n",
      "\n",

      " that the persons who had disposed of his fame, and his most valuable\n",

      " objects of prosecution would, in a great measure, be deprived of the\n",
      "\n",
      " double security intended them by a double trial. The loss of life\n",
      "\n",
      " and estate would often be virtually included in a sentence which, in\n",

      "\n",
      " President will resemble equally that of the king of Great Britain\n",
      "\n",
      " and of the governor of New York. The most material points of\n",
      "\n",
      " difference are these:  First. The President will have only the\n",
      "\n",
      " occasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by\n",
      "\n",
      " legislative provision may be called into the actual service of the\n",

      " Union. The king of Great Britain and the governor of New York have\n",
      "\n",
      " at all times the entire command of all the militia within their\n",
      "\n",
      " several jurisdictions. In this article, therefore, the power of the\n",
      "\n",
      " President would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the\n",
      "\n",
      " governor. Secondly. The President is to be commander-in-chief\n",
      "\n",
      " of the army and navy of the United States. In this respect his\n",
      "\n",
      " authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great\n",
      "\n",
      " Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to\n",
      "\n",
      " nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military\n",
      "\n",
      " and naval forces, as first General and admiral of the Confederacy;\n",
      "\n",
      " while that of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and\n",
      "\n",
      " to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all which, by\n",
      "\n",
      " the Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the\n",
      "\n",
      " legislature.1 The governor of New York, on the other hand, is\n",
      "\n",
      " by the constitution of the State vested only with the command of its\n",
      "\n",
      " militia and navy. But the constitutions of several of the States\n",
      "\n",
      " expressly declare their governors to be commanders-in-chief, as well\n",
      "\n",
      " of the army as navy; and it may well be a question, whether those\n",
      "\n",
      " of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, in particular, do not, in this\n",
      "\n",
      " instance, confer larger powers upon their respective governors, than\n",
      "\n",
      " could be claimed by a President of the United States. Thirdly.\n",
      "\n",
      " The power of the President, in respect to pardons, would extend to\n",
      "\n",
      " all cases, EXCEPT THOSE OF IMPEACHMENT. The governor of New York\n",
      "\n",
      " may pardon in all cases, even in those of impeachment, except for\n",
      "\n",
      " treason and murder. Is not the power of the governor, in this\n",
      "\n",
      " article, on a calculation of political consequences, greater than\n",
      "\n",
      " that of the President? All conspiracies and plots against the\n",
      "\n",
      " government, which have not been matured into actual treason, may be\n",
      "\n",
      " screened from punishment of every kind, by the interposition of the\n",
      "\n",
      " prerogative of pardoning. If a governor of New York, therefore,\n",
      "\n",
      " should be at the head of any such conspiracy, until the design had\n",
      "\n",
      " been ripened into actual hostility he could insure his accomplices\n",
      "\n",
      " and adherents an entire impunity. A President of the Union, on the\n",
      "\n",
      " other hand, though he may even pardon treason, when prosecuted in\n",
      "\n",
      " the ordinary course of law, could shelter no offender, in any\n",
      "\n",
      " degree, from the effects of impeachment and conviction. Would not\n",
      "\n",
      " the prospect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a\n",
      "\n",
      " greater temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise\n",
      "\n",
      " against the public liberty, than the mere prospect of an exemption\n",
      "\n",
      " from death and confiscation, if the final execution of the design,\n",
      "\n",
      " upon an actual appeal to arms, should miscarry? Would this last\n",
      "\n",
      " expectation have any influence at all, when the probability was\n",
      "\n",
      " computed, that the person who was to afford that exemption might\n",
      "\n",
      " himself be involved in the consequences of the measure, and might be\n",
      "\n",
      " incapacitated by his agency in it from affording the desired\n",
      "\n",
      " impunity? The better to judge of this matter, it will be necessary\n",
      "\n",
      " to recollect, that, by the proposed Constitution, the offense of\n",
      "\n",
      " treason is limited ``to levying war upon the United States, and\n",
      "\n",
      " adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort''; and that\n",
      "\n",
      " by the laws of New York it is confined within similar bounds.\n",
      "\n",
      " Fourthly. The President can only adjourn the national legislature\n",
      "\n",
      " in the single case of disagreement about the time of adjournment.\n",
      "\n",
      " The British monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the Parliament.\n",
      "\n",
      " The governor of New York may also prorogue the legislature of this\n",
      "\n",
      " State for a limited time; a power which, in certain situations, may\n",
      "\n",
      " be employed to very important purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President is to have power, with the advice and consent of\n",
      "\n",
      " the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the senators\n",
      "\n",
      " present concur. The king of Great Britain is the sole and absolute\n",
      "\n",
      " representative of the nation in all foreign transactions. He can of\n",
      "\n",
      " his own accord make treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of\n",
      "\n",
      " every other description. It has been insinuated, that his authority\n",
      "\n",
      " in this respect is not conclusive, and that his conventions with\n",
      "\n",
      " foreign powers are subject to the revision, and stand in need of the\n",
      "\n",
      " ratification, of Parliament. But I believe this doctrine was never\n",
      "\n",
      " heard of, until it was broached upon the present occasion. Every\n",
      "\n",
      " jurist2 of that kingdom, and every other man acquainted with its\n",
      "\n",
      " Constitution, knows, as an established fact, that the prerogative of\n",
      "\n",
      " making treaties exists in the crown in its utomst plentitude; and\n",
      "\n",
      " that the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the most\n",
      "\n",
      " complete legal validity and perfection, independent of any other\n",
      "\n",
      " sanction. The Parliament, it is true, is sometimes seen employing\n",
      "\n",
      " itself in altering the existing laws to conform them to the\n",
      "\n",
      " stipulations in a new treaty; and this may have possibly given\n",
      "\n",
      " birth to the imagination, that its co-operation was necessary to the\n",
      "\n",
      " obligatory efficacy of the treaty. But this parliamentary\n",
      "\n",
      " interposition proceeds from a different cause: from the necessity\n",
      "\n",
      " of adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of revenue and\n",
      "\n",
      " commercial laws, to the changes made in them by the operation of the\n",
      "\n",
      " treaty; and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new\n",
      "\n",
      " state of things, to keep the machine from running into disorder. In\n",
      "\n",
      " this respect, therefore, there is no comparison between the intended\n",
      "\n",
      " power of the President and the actual power of the British sovereign. \n",
      "\n",
      " The one can perform alone what the other can do only with the\n",
      "\n",
      " concurrence of a branch of the legislature. It must be admitted,\n",
      "\n",
      " that, in this instance, the power of the federal Executive would\n",
      "\n",
      " exceed that of any State Executive. But this arises naturally from\n",
      "\n",
      " the sovereign power which relates to treaties. If the Confederacy\n",
      "\n",
      " were to be dissolved, it would become a question, whether the\n",
      "\n",
      " Executives of the several States were not solely invested with that\n",
      "\n",
      " delicate and important prerogative.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors\n",
      "\n",
      " and other public ministers. This, though it has been a rich theme\n",
      "\n",
      " of declamation, is more a matter of dignity than of authority. It\n",

      "\n",
      " every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary,\n",
      "\n",
      " has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction\n",
      "\n",
      " either of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and can\n",

      " depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of\n",
      "\n",
      " its judgments.\n",
      "\n",
      "This simple view of the matter suggests several important\n",
      "\n",
      " consequences. It proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond\n",
      "\n",
      " comparison the weakest of the three departments of power1; that\n",
      "\n",
      " it can never attack with success either of the other two; and that\n",
      "\n",
      " all possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against\n",
      "\n",
      " their attacks. It equally proves, that though individual oppression\n",
      "\n",
      " may now and then proceed from the courts of justice, the general\n",
      "\n",
      " liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter; I\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      " liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the\n",
      "\n",
      " legislative and executive powers.''2 And it proves, in the last\n",
      "\n",
      " place, that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary\n",
      "\n",
      " alone, but would have every thing to fear from its union with either\n",
      "\n",
      " of the other departments; that as all the effects of such a union\n",
      "\n",
      " must ensue from a dependence of the former on the latter,\n",
      "\n",
      " notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation; that as, from\n",
      "\n",
      " the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy\n",
      "\n",
      " of being overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate\n",

      "\n",
      " firmness and independence as permanency in office, this quality may\n",
      "\n",
      " therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its\n",

      " justice and the public security.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly\n",
      "\n",
      " essential in a limited Constitution. By a limited Constitution, I\n",

      "\n",
      " that the authority which can declare the acts of another void, must\n",
      "\n",
      " necessarily be superior to the one whose acts may be declared void.\n",
      "\n",
      " As this doctrine is of great importance in all the American\n",
      "\n",
      " constitutions, a brief discussion of the ground on which it rests\n",
      "\n",
      " cannot be unacceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no position which depends on clearer principles, than\n",
      "\n",
      " that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of\n",
      "\n",
      " the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative\n",
      "\n",
      " act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny\n",
      "\n",
      " this, would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his\n",
      "\n",
      " principal; that the servant is above his master; that the\n",
      "\n",
      " representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves;\n",
      "\n",
      " that men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their\n",
      "\n",
      " powers do not authorize, but what they forbid.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it be said that the legislative body are themselves the\n",
      "\n",
      " constitutional judges of their own powers, and that the construction\n",
      "\n",
      " they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may\n",
      "\n",
      " be answered, that this cannot be the natural presumption, where it\n",
      "\n",
      " is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the\n",
      "\n",
      " Constitution. It is not otherwise to be supposed, that the\n",
      "\n",
      " Constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the\n",
      "\n",
      " people to substitute their WILL to that of their constituents. It\n",
      "\n",
      " is far more rational to suppose, that the courts were designed to be\n",
      "\n",
      " an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in\n",
      "\n",
      " order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits\n",
      "\n",
      " assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the\n",
      "\n",
      " proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is, in\n",
      "\n",
      " fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It\n",
      "\n",
      " therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the\n",
      "\n",
      " meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body.\n",
      "\n",
      " If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the\n",

      " course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought\n",
      "\n",
      " to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people to the\n",
      "\n",
      " intention of their agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of\n",
      "\n",
      " the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the\n",
      "\n",
      " power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of\n",
      "\n",
      " the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to\n",
      "\n",
      " that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought\n",
      "\n",
      " to be governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to\n",

      " regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by\n",
      "\n",
      " those which are not fundamental.\n",
      "\n",
      "This exercise of judicial discretion, in determining between two\n",
      "\n",
      " contradictory laws, is exemplified in a familiar instance. It not\n",
      "\n",
      " uncommonly happens, that there are two statutes existing at one\n",
      "\n",
      " time, clashing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of\n",
      "\n",
      " them containing any repealing clause or expression. In such a case,\n",
      "\n",
      " it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning\n",
      "\n",
      " and operation. So far as they can, by any fair construction, be\n",
      "\n",
      " reconciled to each other, reason and law conspire to dictate that\n",
      "\n",
      " this should be done; where this is impracticable, it becomes a\n",
      "\n",
      " matter of necessity to give effect to one, in exclusion of the other. \n",
      "\n",
      " The rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their\n",
      "\n",
      " relative validity is, that the last in order of time shall be\n",
      "\n",
      " preferred to the first. But this is a mere rule of construction,\n",
      "\n",
      " not derived from any positive law, but from the nature and reason of\n",
      "\n",
      " the thing. It is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legislative\n",
      "\n",
      " provision, but adopted by themselves, as consonant to truth and\n",
      "\n",
      " propriety, for the direction of their conduct as interpreters of the\n",
      "\n",
      " law. They thought it reasonable, that between the interfering acts\n",
      "\n",
      " of an EQUAL authority, that which was the last indication of its\n",
      "\n",
      " will should have the preference.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and\n",
      "\n",
      " subordinate authority, of an original and derivative power, the\n",
      "\n",
      " nature and reason of the thing indicate the converse of that rule as\n",
      "\n",
      " proper to be followed. They teach us that the prior act of a\n",
      "\n",
      " superior ought to be preferred to the subsequent act of an inferior\n",
      "\n",
      " and subordinate authority; and that accordingly, whenever a\n",
      "\n",
      " particular statute contravenes the Constitution, it will be the duty\n",
      "\n",
      " of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the\n",
      "\n",
      " former.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense\n",
      "\n",
      " of a repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the\n",
      "\n",
      " constitutional intentions of the legislature. This might as well\n",
      "\n",
      " happen in the case of two contradictory statutes; or it might as\n",
      "\n",
      " well happen in every adjudication upon any single statute. The\n",
      "\n",
      " courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be\n",
      "\n",
      " disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT, the consequence would\n",
      "\n",
      " equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the\n",

      "\n",
      " admits of different answers. Though the fitness and competency of\n",
      "\n",
      " those courts should be allowed in the utmost latitude, yet the\n",
      "\n",
      " substance of the power in question may still be regarded as a\n",
      "\n",
      " necessary part of the plan, if it were only to empower the national\n",
      "\n",
      " legislature to commit to them the cognizance of causes arising out\n",
      "\n",
      " of the national Constitution. To confer the power of determining\n",
      "\n",
      " such causes upon the existing courts of the several States, would\n",
      "\n",
      " perhaps be as much ``to constitute tribunals,'' as to create new\n",

      "\n",
      "I am not sure, but that it will be found highly expedient and\n",
      "\n",
      " useful, to divide the United States into four or five or half a\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      " found in the proposed Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "These reasons seem sufficient to satisfy a candid mind, that the\n",

      " distributed between the supreme and the inferior courts of the Union.\n",

      "\n",
      " only ``in cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and\n",
      "\n",
      " consuls, and those in which A STATE shall be a party.'' Public\n",
      "\n",
      " ministers of every class are the immediate representatives of their\n",
      "\n",
      " sovereigns. All questions in which they are concerned are so\n",
      "\n",
      " directly connected with the public peace, that, as well for the\n",
      "\n",
      " preservation of this, as out of respect to the sovereignties they\n",

      " represent, it is both expedient and proper that such questions\n",
      "\n",
      " should be submitted in the first instance to the highest judicatory\n",
      "\n",
      " of the nation. Though consuls have not in strictness a diplomatic\n",
      "\n",
      " character, yet as they are the public agents of the nations to which\n",
      "\n",
      " they belong, the same observation is in a great measure applicable\n",
      "\n",
      " to them. In cases in which a State might happen to be a party, it\n",

      " would ill suit its dignity to be turned over to an inferior tribunal.\n",
      "\n",
      " Though it may rather be a digression from the immediate subject\n",
      "\n",
      " of this paper, I shall take occasion to mention here a supposition\n",
      "\n",
      " which has excited some alarm upon very mistaken grounds. It has\n",
      "\n",
      " been suggested that an assignment of the public securities of one\n",

      "\n",
      " that State in the federal courts for the amount of those securities;\n",
      "\n",
      " a suggestion which the following considerations prove to be without\n",
      "\n",
      " foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable\n",
      "\n",
      " to the suit of an individual WITHOUT ITS CONSENT. This is the\n",
      "\n",
      " general sense, and the general practice of mankind; and the\n",
      "\n",
      " exemption, as one of the attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed\n",
      "\n",
      " by the government of every State in the Union. Unless, therefore,\n",
      "\n",
      " there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention,\n",
      "\n",
      " it will remain with the States, and the danger intimated must be\n",
      "\n",
      " merely ideal. The circumstances which are necessary to produce an\n",
      "\n",
      " alienation of State sovereignty were discussed in considering the\n",
      "\n",
      " article of taxation, and need not be repeated here. A recurrence to\n",
      "\n",
      " the principles there established will satisfy us, that there is no\n",
      "\n",
      " color to pretend that the State governments would, by the adoption\n",
      "\n",
      " of that plan, be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts\n",
      "\n",
      " in their own way, free from every constraint but that which flows\n",
      "\n",
      " from the obligations of good faith. The contracts between a nation\n",
      "\n",
      " and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign,\n",
      "\n",
      " and have no pretensions to a compulsive force. They confer no right\n",
      "\n",
      " of action, independent of the sovereign will. To what purpose would\n",
      "\n",
      " it be to authorize suits against States for the debts they owe? How\n",
      "\n",
      " could recoveries be enforced? It is evident, it could not be done\n",
      "\n",
      " without waging war against the contracting State; and to ascribe to\n",
      "\n",
      " the federal courts, by mere implication, and in destruction of a\n",
      "\n",
      " pre-existing right of the State governments, a power which would\n",

      " unwarrantable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us resume the train of our observations. We have seen that\n",
      "\n",
      " the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court would be confined to\n",
      "\n",
      " two classes of causes, and those of a nature rarely to occur. In\n",
      "\n",
      " all other cases of federal cognizance, the original jurisdiction\n",
      "\n",
      " would appertain to the inferior tribunals; and the Supreme Court\n",
      "\n",
      " would have nothing more than an appellate jurisdiction, ``with such\n",

      " EXCEPTIONS and under such REGULATIONS as the Congress shall make.''\n",
      "\n",
      "The propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely\n",
      "\n",
      " called in question in regard to matters of law; but the clamors\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      " well-intentioned men in this State, deriving their notions from the\n",
      "\n",
      " language and forms which obtain in our courts, have been induced to\n",
      "\n",
      " consider it as an implied supersedure of the trial by jury, in favor\n",
      "\n",
      " of the civil-law mode of trial, which prevails in our courts of\n",
      "\n",
      " admiralty, probate, and chancery. A technical sense has been\n",
      "\n",
      " affixed to the term ``appellate,'' which, in our law parlance, is\n",
      "\n",
      " commonly used in reference to appeals in the course of the civil law. \n",
      "\n",
      " But if I am not misinformed, the same meaning would not be given\n",
      "\n",
      " to it in any part of New England. There an appeal from one jury to\n",
      "\n",
      " another, is familiar both in language and practice, and is even a\n",
      "\n",
      " matter of course, until there have been two verdicts on one side.\n",
      "\n",
      " The word ``appellate,'' therefore, will not be understood in the\n",
      "\n",
      " same sense in New England as in New York, which shows the\n",
      "\n",
      " impropriety of a technical interpretation derived from the\n",
      "\n",
      " jurisprudence of any particular State. The expression, taken in the\n",
      "\n",
      " abstract, denotes nothing more than the power of one tribunal to\n",
      "\n",
      " review the proceedings of another, either as to the law or fact, or\n",
      "\n",
      " both. The mode of doing it may depend on ancient custom or\n",
      "\n",
      " legislative provision (in a new government it must depend on the\n",
      "\n",
      " latter), and may be with or without the aid of a jury, as may be\n",
      "\n",
      " judged advisable. If, therefore, the re-examination of a fact once\n",
      "\n",
      " determined by a jury, should in any case be admitted under the\n",
      "\n",
      " proposed Constitution, it may be so regulated as to be done by a\n",

      " second trial of the fact, or by directing an issue immediately out\n",
      "\n",
      " of the Supreme Court.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it does not follow that the re-examination of a fact once\n",
      "\n",
      " ascertained by a jury, will be permitted in the Supreme Court. Why\n",
      "\n",
      " may not it be said, with the strictest propriety, when a writ of\n",
      "\n",
      " error is brought from an inferior to a superior court of law in this\n",
      "\n",
      " State, that the latter has jurisdiction of the fact as well as the\n",
      "\n",
      " law? It is true it cannot institute a new inquiry concerning the\n",
      "\n",
      " fact, but it takes cognizance of it as it appears upon the record,\n",
      "\n",
      " and pronounces the law arising upon it.3 This is jurisdiction\n",
      "\n",
      " of both fact and law; nor is it even possible to separate them.\n",
      "\n",
      " Though the common-law courts of this State ascertain disputed facts\n",

      "\n",
      " pleadings, they have no recourse to a jury, but proceed at once to\n",

      " judgment. I contend, therefore, on this ground, that the\n",

      " legislature ``to constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme\n",

      "\n",
      "It has been observed, that trial by jury is a safeguard against\n",
      "\n",
      " an oppressive exercise of the power of taxation. This observation\n",
      "\n",
      " deserves to be canvassed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is evident that it can have no influence upon the\n",

      "\n",
      " OBJECTS upon which they are to be imposed, or to the RULE by which\n",
      "\n",
      " they are to be apportioned. If it can have any influence,\n",
      "\n",
      " therefore, it must be upon the mode of collection, and the conduct\n",
      "\n",
      " of the officers intrusted with the execution of the revenue laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the mode of collection in this State, under our own\n",
      "\n",
      " Constitution, the trial by jury is in most cases out of use. The\n",
      "\n",
      " taxes are usually levied by the more summary proceeding of distress\n",
      "\n",
      " and sale, as in cases of rent. And it is acknowledged on all hands,\n",
      "\n",
      " that this is essential to the efficacy of the revenue laws. The\n",
      "\n",
      " dilatory course of a trial at law to recover the taxes imposed on\n",
      "\n",
      " individuals, would neither suit the exigencies of the public nor\n",
      "\n",
      " promote the convenience of the citizens. It would often occasion an\n",

      " accumulation of costs, more burdensome than the original sum of the\n",
      "\n",
      " tax to be levied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as to the conduct of the officers of the revenue, the\n",

      " the security aimed at. Wilful abuses of a public authority, to the\n",
      "\n",
      " oppression of the subject, and every species of official extortion,\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      " strongest argument in its favor is, that it is a security against\n",
      "\n",
      " corruption. As there is always more time and better opportunity to\n",
      "\n",

      " would more easily find its way to the former than to the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      " The force of this consideration is, however, diminished by others.\n",
      "\n",
      " The sheriff, who is the summoner of ordinary juries, and the clerks\n",

      " of courts, who have the nomination of special juries, are themselves\n",
      "\n",
      " standing officers, and, acting individually, may be supposed more\n",
      "\n",
      " accessible to the touch of corruption than the judges, who are a\n",
      "\n",
      " collective body. It is not difficult to see, that it would be in\n",
      "\n",
      " the power of those officers to select jurors who would serve the\n",
      "\n",
      " purpose of the party as well as a corrupted bench. In the next\n",
      "\n",
      " place, it may fairly be supposed, that there would be less\n",
      "\n",
      " difficulty in gaining some of the jurors promiscuously taken from\n",
      "\n",
      " the public mass, than in gaining men who had been chosen by the\n",

      " government for their probity and good character. But making every\n",
      "\n",
      " deduction for these considerations, the trial by jury must still be\n",
      "\n",
      " a valuable check upon corruption. It greatly multiplies the\n",
      "\n",
      " impediments to its success. As matters now stand, it would be\n",
      "\n",
      " necessary to corrupt both court and jury; for where the jury have\n",
      "\n",
      " gone evidently wrong, the court will generally grant a new trial,\n",
      "\n",
      " and it would be in most cases of little use to practice upon the\n",
      "\n",
      " jury, unless the court could be likewise gained. Here then is a\n",
      "\n",
      " double security; and it will readily be perceived that this\n",
      "\n",
      " complicated agency tends to preserve the purity of both institutions. \n",
      "\n",
      " By increasing the obstacles to success, it discourages attempts to\n",

      " seduce the integrity of either. The temptations to prostitution\n",
      "\n",
      " which the judges might have to surmount, must certainly be much\n",
      "\n",
      " fewer, while the co-operation of a jury is necessary, than they\n",
      "\n",
      " might be, if they had themselves the exclusive determination of all\n",
      "\n",
      " causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding, therefore, the doubts I have expressed, as to\n",
      "\n",
      " the essentiality of trial by jury in civil cases to liberty, I admit\n",
      "\n",
      " that it is in most cases, under proper regulations, an excellent\n",

      " ought to be comprehended. There is, however, in all cases, great\n",
      "\n",
      " difficulty in this; and men not blinded by enthusiasm must be\n",

      " little augmented. For my own part, at every new view I take of the\n",
      "\n",
      " subject, I become more convinced of the reality of the obstacles\n",
      "\n",
      " which, we are authoritatively informed, prevented the insertion of a\n",
      "\n",
      " provision on this head in the plan of the convention.\n",

      "The great difference between the limits of the jury trial in\n",

      "\n",
      " omission complained of in regard to this point, an explanation of it\n",
      "\n",
      " is necessary. In this State, our judicial establishments resemble,\n",
      "\n",
      " more nearly than in any other, those of Great Britain. We have\n",
      "\n",
      " courts of common law, courts of probates (analogous in certain\n",
      "\n",
      " matters to the spiritual courts in England), a court of admiralty\n",
      "\n",
      " and a court of chancery. In the courts of common law only, the\n",
      "\n",
      " trial by jury prevails, and this with some exceptions. In all the\n",

      " others a single judge presides, and proceeds in general either\n",
      "\n",
      " according to the course of the canon or civil law, without the aid\n",
      "\n",
      " of a jury.1 In New Jersey, there is a court of chancery which\n",
      "\n",
      " proceeds like ours, but neither courts of admiralty nor of probates,\n",
      "\n",
      " in the sense in which these last are established with us. In that\n",
      "\n",
      " State the courts of common law have the cognizance of those causes\n",
      "\n",
      " which with us are determinable in the courts of admiralty and of\n",
      "\n",
      " probates, and of course the jury trial is more extensive in New\n",
      "\n",
      " Jersey than in New York. In Pennsylvania, this is perhaps still\n",
      "\n",
      " more the case, for there is no court of chancery in that State, and\n",
      "\n",
      " its common-law courts have equity jurisdiction. It has a court of\n",

      " is called a special jury, and for which a particular mode of\n",

      " which the trial by jury would be proper; or that if desirous of a\n",
      "\n",
      " more extensive provision, they found it impracticable to devise one\n",

      "\n",
      " made respecting the courts that subsist in the several States of the\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      " requested it; but in another State, a cause exactly similar to the\n",

      "\n",
      " abridgements of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations of\n",

      " their primitive signification, they have no application to\n",
      "\n",
      " constitutions professedly founded upon the power of the people, and\n",

      "\n",
      " merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the\n",

      "\n",
      " species of personal and private concerns. If, therefore, the loud\n",
      "\n",
      " clamors against the plan of the convention, on this score, are well\n",
      "\n",
      " founded, no epithets of reprobation will be too strong for the\n",

      " contain all which, in relation to their objects, is reasonably to be\n",
      "\n",
      " desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and\n",
      "\n",
      " to the extent in which they are contended for, are not only\n",
      "\n",
      " unnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be\n",
      "\n",
      " dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers not\n",
      "\n",
      " granted; and, on this very account, would afford a colorable\n",
      "\n",
      " pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that\n",
      "\n",
      " things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why, for\n",
      "\n",
      " instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not\n",
      "\n",
      " be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be\n",
      "\n",
      " imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a\n",
      "\n",
      " regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men\n",
      "\n",
      " disposed to usurp, a plausible pretense for claiming that power.\n",
      "\n",
      " They might urge with a semblance of reason, that the Constitution\n",
      "\n",
      " ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the\n",
      "\n",
      " abuse of an authority which was not given, and that the provision\n",
      "\n",
      " against restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear\n",
      "\n",
      " implication, that a power to prescribe proper regulations concerning\n",
      "\n",
      " it was intended to be vested in the national government. This may\n",
      "\n",
      " serve as a specimen of the numerous handles which would be given to\n",
      "\n",
      " the doctrine of constructive powers, by the indulgence of an\n",
      "\n",
      " injudicious zeal for bills of rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the subject of the liberty of the press, as much as has been\n",
      "\n",
      " said, I cannot forbear adding a remark or two: in the first place,\n",
      "\n",
      " I observe, that there is not a syllable concerning it in the\n",
      "\n",
      " constitution of this State; in the next, I contend, that whatever\n",
      "\n",
      " has been said about it in that of any other State, amounts to\n",
      "\n",
      " nothing. What signifies a declaration, that ``the liberty of the\n",
      "\n",
      " press shall be inviolably preserved''? What is the liberty of the\n",
      "\n",
      " press? Who can give it any definition which would not leave the\n",
      "\n",
      " utmost latitude for evasion? I hold it to be impracticable; and\n",
      "\n",
      " from this I infer, that its security, whatever fine declarations may\n",
      "\n",
      " be inserted in any constitution respecting it, must altogether\n",
      "\n",
      " depend on public opinion, and on the general spirit of the people\n",
      "\n",
      " and of the government.3 And here, after all, as is intimated\n",
      "\n",
      " upon another occasion, must we seek for the only solid basis of all\n",
      "\n",
      " our rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "There remains but one other view of this matter to conclude the\n",
      "\n",
      " point. The truth is, after all the declamations we have heard, that\n",
      "\n",
      " the Constitution is itself, in every rational sense, and to every\n",
      "\n",
      " useful purpose, A BILL OF RIGHTS. The several bills of rights in\n",
      "\n",
      " Great Britain form its Constitution, and conversely the constitution\n",
      "\n",
      " of each State is its bill of rights. And the proposed Constitution,\n",
      "\n",
      " if adopted, will be the bill of rights of the Union. Is it one\n",
      "\n",
      " object of a bill of rights to declare and specify the political\n",
      "\n",
      " privileges of the citizens in the structure and administration of\n",
      "\n",
      " the government? This is done in the most ample and precise manner\n",
      "\n",
      " in the plan of the convention; comprehending various precautions\n",
      "\n",
      " for the public security, which are not to be found in any of the\n",
      "\n",
      " State constitutions. Is another object of a bill of rights to\n",
      "\n",
      " define certain immunities and modes of proceeding, which are\n",
      "\n",
      " relative to personal and private concerns? This we have seen has\n",
      "\n",
      " also been attended to, in a variety of cases, in the same plan.\n",
      "\n",
      " Adverting therefore to the substantial meaning of a bill of rights,\n",
      "\n",
      " it is absurd to allege that it is not to be found in the work of the\n",
      "\n",
      " convention. It may be said that it does not go far enough, though\n",
      "\n",
      " it will not be easy to make this appear; but it can with no\n",
      "\n",
      " propriety be contended that there is no such thing. It certainly\n",
      "\n",
      " must be immaterial what mode is observed as to the order of\n",
      "\n",
      " declaring the rights of the citizens, if they are to be found in any\n",
      "\n",
      " part of the instrument which establishes the government. And hence\n",
      "\n",
      " it must be apparent, that much of what has been said on this subject\n",
      "\n",
      " rests merely on verbal and nominal distinctions, entirely foreign\n",
      "\n",
      " from the substance of the thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another objection which has been made, and which, from the\n",
      "\n",
      " frequency of its repetition, it is to be presumed is relied on, is\n",
      "\n",
      " of this nature: ``It is improper say the objectors to confer such\n",
      "\n",
      " large powers, as are proposed, upon the national government, because\n",
      "\n",
      " the seat of that government must of necessity be too remote from\n",
      "\n",
      " many of the States to admit of a proper knowledge on the part of the\n",
      "\n",
      " constituent, of the conduct of the representative body.'' This\n",
      "\n",
      " argument, if it proves any thing, proves that there ought to be no\n",
      "\n",
      " general government whatever. For the powers which, it seems to be\n",
      "\n",
      " agreed on all hands, ought to be vested in the Union, cannot be\n",
      "\n",
      " safely intrusted to a body which is not under every requisite\n",
      "\n",
      " control. But there are satisfactory reasons to show that the\n",
      "\n",
      " objection is in reality not well founded. There is in most of the\n",
      "\n",
      " arguments which relate to distance a palpable illusion of the\n",
      "\n",
      " imagination. What are the sources of information by which the\n",
      "\n",
      " people in Montgomery County must regulate their judgment of the\n",
      "\n",
      " conduct of their representatives in the State legislature? Of\n",
      "\n",
      " personal observation they can have no benefit. This is confined to\n",
      "\n",
      " the citizens on the spot. They must therefore depend on the\n",
      "\n",
      " information of intelligent men, in whom they confide; and how must\n",
      "\n",
      " these men obtain their information? Evidently from the complexion\n",

      " with theirrepresentatives, and with other persons who reside at the\n",

      "\n",
      " that may attend the establishment of the proposed government. The\n",
      "\n",
      " first thing which presents itself is that a great part of the\n",

      " business which now keeps Congress sitting through the year will be\n",
      "\n",
      " transacted by the President. Even the management of foreign\n",

      "\n",
      " principles concerted with the Senate, and subject to their final\n",
      "\n",
      " concurrence. Hence it is evident that a portion of the year will\n",
      "\n",
      " suffice for the session of both the Senate and the House of\n",

      " Senate. From this circumstance we may infer that, until the House\n",
      "\n",
      " of Representatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present\n",

      " Hence it has happened that the sessions of the State legislatures\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      " execution of the mere local business of the States. More than half\n",
      "\n",
      " their time has been frequently employed in matters which related to\n",

      "\n",
      " in it on another account. The intrinsic difficulty of governing\n",
      "\n",
      " thirteen States at any rate, independent of calculations upon an\n",
      "\n",
      " ordinary degree of public spirit and integrity, will, in my opinion\n",

      " constituents. But there is yet a further consideration, which\n",
      "\n",
      " proves beyond the possibility of a doubt, that the observation is\n",
      "\n",
      " futile. It is this that the national rulers, whenever nine States\n",
      "\n",
      " concur, will have no option upon the subject. By the fifth article\n",
      "\n",
      " of the plan, the Congres will be obliged ``on the application of the\n",
