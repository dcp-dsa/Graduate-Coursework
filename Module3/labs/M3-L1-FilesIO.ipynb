    "# Reading and Writing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, you have seen some examples of using files and you are probably familiar with computer files in general. In this lesson, we are going to provide a little more depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Files are a key concept of the stored program computer, which is the common data computer, smart phone, tablet, and just about every other computing device. A file is a simply a sequence of computer bytes which has a name and starting location associated within the file system. The key difference between files and memory is that files are persistent, that is if the system is powered down, the files will be available when the system is powered back on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at an image from earlier in the boot camp:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Computer Programming](../images/ComputerProgram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of computer programs, either the input or output or both can be files. This is often the case when you are using python to massage and un-mangle data that exists in a collection of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Type\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a file type is nearly irrelevant for a file stored on the secondary storage system.  However, we often conceptually divide files into two classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  *  Text files, e.g., plain, readable characters within the file\n",
    "  *  Binary files, e.g., files of bytes which have some structure that is relevant to a particular application\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we conceptualize hundreds of types of binary files, ranging from PDF, Office, Audio/video, etc. as one type - binary?  The character mode versus binary mode is usually all that matters when opening a file to read or write within a program. In either case, the file is a sequence of bytes. In the text file, the bytes encode characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Files\n",
    "\n",
    "The general pattern of file usages/opearations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  *  Open file (ether in read or write mode)\n",
    "  *  Read or Write file\n",
    "  *  Close file\n",
    "\n",
    "By opening a file, we are telling a computer system to look at the sequence of bytes referenced by the file name and prepare to read and/or write bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as a file name is a handle to reference the sequence of bytes in the file system, opening a file assigns the open file to a handle in Python. The labs at the end of this module will get into various examples for file input and output.\n"

    "Access modes govern the type of operations possible in the opened file. It refers to how the file will be used once it’s opened. These modes also define the location of the File Handle in the file. File handle is like a cursor, which defines from where the data has to be read or written in the file. Different access modes for reading a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Read Only ('r'):** Open the file for reading. We can read the contents, but cannot update it. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode i.e., if mode is not mentioned then the file will be opened in read mode.\n",
    "* **Write Only (‘w’):** Open the file for writing. For an existing file, the data is truncated and over-written. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. Creates the file if the file does not exist.\n",
    "* **Write and Read (‘w+’):** Open the file for reading and writing. For an existing file, data is truncated and over-written. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "* **Append Only (‘a’):** Open the file for writing. The file is created if it does not exist. The handle is positioned at the end of the file. The data being written will be inserted at the end, after the existing data.\n",
