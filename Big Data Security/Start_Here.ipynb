    "# Python Programming Boot Camp for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "__Synopsis:__ This course teaches participants how to program in Python, including the use of auxiliary libraries in various Python ecosystems. Participants are introduced to Jupyter notebook, an interactive programming environment, as well as Pythonâ€™s use across the spectrum of data science courses and topics. Many activities are focused on data ingestion, cleaning, manipulation, and restructuring (e.g., ETL).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Course Design:__ This course has five modules. The fifth module is an optional one and will not be graded. \n",
    "This course is delivered with asynchronous online mode and activities using the JupyterHub learning environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "In each module it is important to ask and answer questions. \n",
    "All students should ask. Everyone should try to answer at least once. \n",
    "We learn by solving our own problems and helping others solve theirs.\n",
    "Social learning theory helps to explain the mechanics of how communicating with others aids learning.\n",
    "It suggests that people learn from one another, via observation, imitation, and modeling. \n",
    "The theory has often been called a bridge between behaviorist and cognitive learning theories because it encompasses attention, memory, and motivation. \n",
    "If you think about the most rewarding learning experiences in your life, \n",
    "its likely you will recall a time when you struggled, sought help, provided help and ultimately achieved your aims. \n",
    "And probably helped others achieve theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructors and TAs will help the discussions and mutual aid stay on track.\n",
    "We look forward to working with all of you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual aid is a place to discuss the topic and issue you are having. It is not a place to post code, working or not for feedback or solutions. Posting code is counterproductive  in this type of Mutual Aid environment. \n",
